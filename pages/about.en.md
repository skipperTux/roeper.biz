Hi, my name is Christoph Roeper. I have been working as an independent Software Developer and System Administrator since 1995. Located in Aachen, Germany, I have also been working as a development lead, and in consulting and management for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Moreover, I invest in companies specialized in consulting and developing ERP-based solutions.

I came into home-computing back in 1983 and started learning BASIC, Z80-Assembler, Forth and Pascal. My current professional work is done in Linux and Microsoft Windows environments, mainly developing server-side business solutions, and building or maintaining the infrastructure to operate these solutions. I have done software development using various [3GLs]({{ site.data.links.thirdGenerationLang }}) and some [DSLs]({{ site.data.links.domainSpecificLang[site.active_lang] }}) as well as all sorts of libraries and frameworks.

I also have a strong background in managing Software Projects and Development Teams, be it individual development or standard off-the-shelf software. My professional experience includes business software like enterprise resource planning (ERP), warehouse/logistics (WMS), document management (DMS) and customer relationship management (CRM).
