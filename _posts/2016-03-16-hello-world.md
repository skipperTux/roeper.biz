title: Hello, World
---

A new web log sees the light and says "Hello World!" The topic here is mostly information technology with regards to software development, administration and operations.

Also expect posts with regards to business technology and enterprise software like [Smart Glasses](https://www.google.com/glass/start/) or [SAP](http://www.sap.com/) focusing on Production and Logistics. 

For now, enjoy browsing the rest of my website, or hop over to the [The Hello World Collection](http://www.roesler-ac.de/wolfram/hello.htm), the biggest collection of Hello World programs on the Internet, to learn how the say "Hello World!" in hundreds of different programming and human languages.

This side is made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a simple, blog-aware, static site generator with the help of [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), the Jekyll Butler and [Polyglot](http://untra.github.io/polyglot/), a i18n plugin for multiple language content.
