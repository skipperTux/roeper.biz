A new web log sees the light and says "Hello World!" The topic here is mostly information technology with regards to software development, administration and operations.

Also expect posts with regards to business technology and enterprise software like [Smart Glasses](https://www.google.com/glass/start/) or [SAP](http://www.sap.com/) focusing on Production and Logistics.
