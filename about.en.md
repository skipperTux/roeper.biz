Hi, my name is Christoph Roeper. I have been working as an independent Software Developer and System Administrator since 1995. Located in Aachen, Germany, I have also been working as a development lead, and in consulting and management for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Moreover, I invest in companies specialized in consulting and developing ERP-based solutions. 

I came into home-computing back in 1983 and started learning BASIC, Z80-Assembler, Forth and Pascal. My current professional work is done in Linux and Microsoft Windows environments, mainly developing server-side business solutions using the .NET framework and C#. I have also done development using other languages, like Java, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, Object Pascal and all sorts of libraries and frameworks, too.

I also have a strong background in managing Software Projects and Development Teams, be it individual development or standard off-the-shelf software. My professional experience includes business software like enterprise resource planning (ERP), warehouse/logistics (WMS), document management (DMS) and customer relationship management (CRM).
